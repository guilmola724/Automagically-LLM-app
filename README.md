## NOTE: THIS IS VERY MUCH ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§. A lot of the features are yet to come - stay tuned!

## About

The ultimate starter repo for building full-stack, type-safe, LLM-powered web apps. It uses:
- [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/) for monorepo management
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) for API routing
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for database access
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the web app
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for the AI
- [Langchain](https://hwchase17.github.io/langchainjs/docs/overview) for LLM management

And much more!

## FAQ


## Quick Start

To get it running, follow the steps below:

### Setup dependencies

```diff
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# In packages/db/prisma update schema.prisma provider to use sqlite
# or use your own database provider
- provider = "postgresql"
+ provider = "sqlite"

# Configure environment variables.
# There is an `.env.example` in the root directory you can use for reference
# Make sure you add the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable!
cp .env.example .env

# Push the Prisma schema to your database
pnpm db:push
```

## Deployment

### Next.js

#### Prerequisites

_We do not recommend deploying a SQLite database on serverless environments since the data wouldn't be persisted. I provisioned a quick Postgresql database on [Railway](https://railway.app), but you can of course use any other database provider. Make sure the prisma schema is updated to use the correct database._

**Please note that the Next.js application with tRPC must be deployed in order for the Expo app to communicate with the server in a production environment.**

#### Deploy to Vercel

Let's deploy the Next.js application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). If you have ever deployed a Turborepo app there, the steps are quite straightforward. You can also read the [official Turborepo guide](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/monorepos/turborepo) on deploying to Vercel.

1. Create a new project on Vercel, select the `apps/nextjs` folder as the root directory and apply the following build settings:

> The install command filters out the expo package and saves a few second (and cache size) of dependency installation. The build command makes us build the application using Turbo.

2. Add your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

3. Done! Your app should successfully deploy. Assign your domain and use that instead of `localhost` for the `url` in the Expo app so that your Expo app can communicate with your backend when you are not in development.

## TODO

- [ ] Organize prompts in a prompt library (rather than leaving them in the API folder)
- [ ] Add Promptable.js option
- [ ] Add embeddings example
- [ ] Add PromptLayer example
- [ ] Add Vercel Edge Functions to handle streaming
- [ ] Add ChatGPT w/ memory example
- [ ] Add LLM + Agents example
- [ ] Update to NextJS app directory (once stable)
